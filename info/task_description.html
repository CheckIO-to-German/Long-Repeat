      There are four substring missions</a>
    that were all born in one day and you shouldnâ€™t need more than one day to solve them.<br>
    All these missions can simply be solved by a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search" target="_blank">
      brute-force search</a>, but is this always the best way, too?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong><br>
    You may not have access to all these missions yet, but they will become available
    when you unlock more islands.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  This mission is the first of the series.<br>
  You have to find the length of the longest substring which consists of a single letter.<br>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>An example:</strong><br>
  The line <em>"aaabbcaaaa"</em> contains four substrings consisting of only one letter:
  <em>"aaa"</em>, <em>"bb"</em>, <em>"c"</em> and <em>"aaaa"</em>.<br>
  The last of these substrings &ndash; <em>"aaaa"</em> &ndash; is the longest one, so
  &ndash; since you have to return the length of the longest substring &ndash; the correct
  answer is 4.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Input: </strong> A single line as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The length of the longest substring as in int.
